ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Operations, Information & Decisions department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

I have received my Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s Degree in Systems Science & Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science where I was a Penn World Scholar.

My research interests center around the use of machine learning techniques to understand and optimize decision-making in operations management problems. For more contact informationa and more, please access [enzobergamo.com](https://www.enzobergamo.com).
